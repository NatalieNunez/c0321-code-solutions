User Can Sign Up
  - When the user clicks on the 'Sign Up' link in the Navbar component, it brings
  the user to the AuthForm component which then checks what the action was based
  on the path which is 'sign-up'.

  The user then inputs their username and password into the respective fields (which
  are both required fields), listening for change events. In the handleChange method,
  it checks the event.target (whether usernmae field or password field), and updates
  state to contain the values inputted by the user. User clicks on the Register button
  which triggers the handleSubmit method. The default action is prevented and a POST
  fetch request is sent to the server with their inputted values.

  The server's post request handler checks if a username and password are provided. If
  not it throws an error with code 400. If it is provided, it hashes the password with
  the hash method, queries the database and then inserts the username and hashed password
  into users table of the database and sends a 201 to show the client the new user has been
  created as well as the response in JSON.

  Back on the client side it gets the response and parses it, then checks if the action was
  'sign-up' and if so, it redirects the user to the sign-in page by updating the window.location.hash
  to be 'sign-in'.
